	 <p> I am the bone of my sword </p>
	 <p> Steel is my body and fire is my blood </p>
	 <p> I have created over a thousand blades </p>
	 <p> Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life </p>
	 <p> Have withstood pain to create many weapons </p>
	 <p> Yet, those hands will never hold anything </p>
	 <p> So as I pray, unlimited blade works.</p>
